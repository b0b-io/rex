# 🔭 Rex - Registry Explorer

A fast, modern command-line tool for exploring OCI-compliant container
registries.

## Project Status

⚠️ **Under Active Development** - Rex is currently in the design and early
implementation phase. The API and commands are subject to change.

## About

Rex provides both a CLI for scripting/automation and an interactive TUI for
visual exploration of OCI-compliant container registries. Primary target is
Zot registry with support for any OCI Distribution Specification v1.0+
compliant registry.

For detailed project requirements, see [docs/req.md](docs/req.md).

For architecture and design details, see [docs/design.md](docs/design.md).
